# Rust Hash Functions Practice

## Overview

Welcome to my Rust Hash Functions Practice project! As a beginner in the Rust programming language, I'm using this repository as a hands-on playground to hone my skills. The primary focus is on practicing Rust syntax, ownership system, and overall programming concepts by implementing various hash functions.

## Project Goals

- **Learning Rust:** This project is part of my journey to become proficient in Rust. Each hash function implementation is a practical exercise aimed at understanding Rust's unique features and principles.

- **Coding Exploration:** As I delve into Rust, I am using hash functions as a medium to explore different aspects of the language. This includes structuring code, handling errors, and leveraging Rust's strong type system.

## Implemented Hash Functions

The project currently includes basic implementations of popular hash functions, such as:
- **SHA-1**
- **SHA-2**
- **MD** (soon)

## How to Use

As this project is primarily for practice, there are no strict usage instructions. Feel free to explore the code in the `src` directory and experiment with modifications. Run the examples to observe the behavior of the implemented hash functions, and use this space to experiment and learn without the pressure of strict guidelines.

## Feedback

As a Rust beginner, i'm open to any feedback or advices, whether it's related to better coding practices, idiomatic Rust, or general programming tips.
